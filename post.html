  <h2> Title Of The Blog Post </h2>
  <br>
  <p><em> Are you having a bad hair day/week/month? It’s your hair care, not you! Below we explain why switching to natural hair care products could just be the best thing you do for the health of your locks. </em>
    <br>
    <br>
    The winter months affect us in many ways. Our bodies crave more comforting, warming and filling foods and our skin needs extra attention as it battles the colder climes. But while you’re taking extra care to use richer moisturiser and incorporating oils and serums into your skin routine, how often do you consider that your hair requires just as much TLC to combat the changing seasons?
    <br>
    <br>
    <b> What exactly causes damage to our hair? </b>
    <br>
    First, there are environmental aggressors; pollution, wind, rain and the sudden changes in temperature from indoors to outdoors. Then, there’s heat styling, colouring and chemical-laden products which compromise the levels of amino acids which make up your hair, causing weakness that leads to frizzy, dehydrated or lacklustre strands. While we can’t prevent the damage from external factors, we can counter their effects by making smart, clean choices on the hair products we choose.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b> What should we be avoiding when it comes to hair care? </b>
    <br>
    The hair follicles on our scalps are open and susceptible to absorbing the chemicals found in synthetic products, meaning you’re taking in toxins without even realising it, and they can affect more than just your hair. Nancy Twine, founder of natural haircare brand Briogeo says they “have been linked to things like skin lipid damage, hormonal imbalances, and endocrine disruption.” A 2016 study from the University of California, Berkeley, showed that short breaks from shampoos with chemical ingredients led to a significant drop in the levels of people’s hormone-disrupting chemicals.
    “You are what you eat and your hair is what you put on it” says Nancy. Much like reading your food labels, checking the labels on your hair products is the easiest way to avoid nasties. Look out for parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Myreth Sulfate, petrochemicals, synthetic fragrances and oxybenzone. These are used as preservatives, foaming agents, very strong detergents, thickeners and emulsifiers, but are proven to be harmful.

    <br>
    <b> What are the alternatives? </b>
    <br>
    There are plenty of products made from natural, plant-based ingredients that are gentle on your hair and will still give you the results you are looking for. They’re also less likely to irritate your scalp or strip your hair of the necessary oils it creates itself. Seaweed and other algae extracts are proven to stimulate hair-growth and a hero ingredient now found in many products is biotin, also known as vitamin B7. This vitamin counteracts signs of damage to your hair by improving the structure of keratin, which are the building blocks for your hair. Panthenol, essential oils, wheat germ and silk proteins are other beneficial ingredients.

    In terms of reversing the effects of long-term use of cheap/chemical-laden products, it can be done! “You can really focus and nurture your hair to revive it and bring it back to it’s best shape.” Says Nancy. “This means a lot of intense moisturizing and nourishing not only of your hair but your scalp as well. If you’ve been using a lot of chemical-driven products, your scalp is probably suffering which then causes our hair to not grow the best it can.”

    If you’re already choosing to shop for organic foods and natural beauty and makeup products, then shifting to a greener hair routine that’s more in line with your diet and skincare values makes sense, right? Here are some great hair products and tools which we’re currently using and loving:
