            <b>Misha</b>, is very passionate about beauty and wellness.  She obtained a Cosmetic Science degree in 2008 from London College of Fashion and has been formulating, and mixing beauty products ever since.  Having travelled to the Gambia, where her paternal grandfather was from, she discovered the magical moringa plant.  With so many different forms  and health and beauty usages, moringa can be used in a multitude of ways.  From moringa oil for the skin, body and hair; to moringa seeds which can be ingested; to moringa powder tea.  The beauty and wellness possibilities are endless.  Every purchase you will directly impact the livelihood of rural communities in one of the poorest regions of Africa.
            <br>
            Similarly to Misha, <b>Agata</b> is an avid traveller. In the past she has created her own travel blog where she shared her experience as a solo female traveller and also developed an interest in web design. Having completed a degree in Psychology with Education, Agata is keen to combine her knowledge of human behaviour with her interest in technology and design. She was very excited to help Misha to develop a website for her beauty and wellness products!
